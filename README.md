A to-do/tasks JavaScript website that allows organization by project as well as priority and due date. Done for The Odin Project's Intermediate JavaScript module

In this project I utilized:

1. Webpack
2. Custom Node.JS scripts to run a live dev server
3. Encapsulation via modules
4. Factory functions
5. CSS Grid and Flexbox
6. Basic OOP (making some variables private with closure)

Things I learned:

1. S.O.L.I.D clean code (really eye opening, ended up creating a lot of little functions that made my more substantial functions cleaner to read)
2. Using 'return' in a forEach loop does NOT exit the function the forEach loop is in, only the forEach loop itself (this bug took me a day to fix haha)
3. ChatGPT is really good for generating CSS. Thanks ChatGPT and please don't kill me in the AI uprising
4. Modules are awesome for cleaner code, they are basically like .h files in C++
